# Deep Learning Workflow for Image Classification

This repository provides a deep learning workflow for image classification using transfer learning with pre-trained models such as **DenseNet201**, **InceptionV3**, and others. The workflow covers all essential steps from dataset preparation to model evaluation and visualization of the modelâ€™s inner workings.

## Features

- **Dataset Splitting**: Automatically split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets using `splitfolders`.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models like **DenseNet201** for image classification tasks with custom dataset classes.
- **Image Augmentation**: Use `ImageDataGenerator` for preprocessing and augmentation (e.g., resizing, normalization, and more).
- **Model Training**: Train models with callbacks for `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` to prevent overfitting and adjust learning rates.
- **Evaluation**: Visualize training accuracy and loss, compute confusion matrices, and assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Map Visualization**: Visualize feature maps from convolutional layers to understand how the model processes images.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-workflow.git
    cd deep-learning-workflow
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare Dataset**:
    Place your dataset in the `data/` folder and use `splitfolders` to split it:
    ```python
    splitfolders.ratio('data/', output='data/split/', seed=1337, ratio=(.1, .1, .8))
    ```

4. **Train the Model**:
    Run the provided notebook or scripts to train the model. You can adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs.
    
5. **Evaluate the Model**:
    After training, evaluate the model on the test set. Visualize accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix with:
    ```python
    model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
    ```

6. **Predict on New Data**:
    Generate predictions using your trained model and analyze the results.
